# car-parking
It is assumed to have a parking tower which has small medium and large slots for parking two wheeler like bike and motorcycle and four wheeler like car and bus. Bike can park in small and medium slots. Car can park in medium or large slot. Bus can park in 5 large slots. A bike can be parked in same medium slot if space available.\
&emsp; The parking slots are limited and their are many vehicles. For a bike and bus default slots were fixed. But for car, it should be registered for a slot, as per requirement. So, first come first serve policy is implemented in that tower for registered vehicles only. \
&emsp;Registered vehicles are given with a unique ID card. When vehicle comes it scans and verifies the registration and tells the availability of concerned slot.\
Based on the above information, this project is designed with OOPS concept in C++.
